The following files were removed as part of the migration to PostgreSQL-only:
- init_db.py (deleted)
- populate_db.py (deleted) 
- schema.sql (deleted)

These files were SQLite-specific and no longer needed after migration to PostgreSQL-only support.

Additional cleanup completed:
- Removed all SQLite imports and references from database.py
- Simplified db_utils.py to PostgreSQL-only functions
- Updated comments in schema_postgresql.sql and init_postgresql.py
